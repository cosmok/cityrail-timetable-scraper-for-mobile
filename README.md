Cityrail Timetable on Mobile Devices
====================================

[Check out an example](http://cr.trk7.com/ "A live webpage running this code")

What
------------------
It's a Cityrail(Sydney, Australia) timetable lister that is optimized for certain mobile devices (I have only tested it on; HTC Touch, iPhone and Samsung GalaxyS).

I use HTML5 storage to store and retrieve history.

Currently, there is no way to specify a particular time or day (it uses current Day and Time (AEST)).

How
------------------
I use PHP to scrape the [131500](http://131500.com.au "Official Timetables") website to get the timetables.

If you would like to build your own app and just need an api to get the timetables then, just look at the getTimetable.php file.
