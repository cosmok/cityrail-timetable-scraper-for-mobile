Cityrail Timetable on Mobile Devices
====================================

[Check out an example](http://77.92.77.138:8080/cr/ "A live webpage running this code")

What
------------------
It's a Cityrail(Sydney, Australia) timetable lister that is optimized for certain mobile devices (I have only tested it on; HTC Touch, iPhone and Samsung GalaxyS).

I use HTML5 storage to store and retrieve history.

Currently, there is no way to specify a particular time or day (it uses current Day and Time (AEST)).

How
------------------
I use PHP to scrape the [131500](http://131500.com.au "Official Timetables") website to get the timetables.
